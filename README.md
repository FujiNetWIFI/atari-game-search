# atari-game-search

A server and client pair that allows a user to search a public game collection (such as HomeSoft) and run the game.

The server scans a folder recursively and returns sub-paths based on substring matches, as ATARI screen data.

The client asks the server for matches, and then opens a connection to read them.

## WARNING

This code is a prototype and really needs refactoring.
